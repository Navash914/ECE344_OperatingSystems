This directory currently provides four tests. All these tests need to be run
from the parent directory (fs, not fs/tests).

All tests send their output to a file. They print a PASS when this output file
matches the expected output file, or else they print FAIL.

For example, for the test_rw test described below, we have provided you the
expected output in the tests/test_rw.out file. The output generated by your
program is written to test_rw.out (in the fs directory). The test_rw test
compares these files.

1. test_rw

This reads and writes to direct and indirect blocks but at multi-block
granularity. It will pass once multi-block read/write is implemented.

2. test_rw_large

This tests reads and writes via the double indirect block.

3. test_rw_too_big

This tests writes beyond the maximum file size. Note that the way the test is
setup, the file size will increase because a partial write occurs (but the file
size should not become larger than the maximum file size).

4. test_rw_no_space

This tests for writes when the file system is full.



These scripts generate input for testfs. For your convenience, this input is
stored in tests/test_rw.txt. After running these tests one time, you can use
this stored input to run tests manually as follows:

# in fs directory
mktestfs device; testfs < tests/test_rw.txt

# for debugging
$ mktestfs device; gdb ./testfs
(gdb) run -n device < tests/test_rw.txt
